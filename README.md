# V2ray Server Setup Guide

> **üí° 2025 Update**: V2Ray with REALITY protocol remains the most effective method for bypassing the Great Firewall of China. The REALITY protocol eliminates server-side TLS fingerprints and provides superior camouflage compared to traditional VPN protocols, making it significantly harder for the GFW to detect and block.

I tried to install V2Ray on several cloud hosting platforms, including AWS (including Lightsail) and Digital Ocean. However, none of the configurations I experimented with could reliably penetrate China's Great Firewall on AWS servers. Vultr rejected my payment card, so I had to look for alternatives. I chose Digital Ocean. Digital Ocean has been running smoothly for several weeks, with excellent reliability and minimal speed loss.

Using this system has been economical, as each server costs $4-6 a month (DigitalOcean's entry-level droplets start at $4/month as of 2025). Although it has the potential for commercial use, my main goal is to provide this information to travelers to China so they can save $30/month on services like Astrill that often require switching between servers. Both Astrill and V2Ray worked in my experience, but I found the V2Ray setup to be more reliable.

However, there are some drawbacks compared to other VPNs like Astrill, such as the lack of URL-specific bypasses. This may not be a big issue for me while traveling in China, but it may be a problem if you plan to live here for a long time.

If you want to avoid VPNs altogether, the easiest way is to use a SIM card from Hong Kong (if you're flying in from there) or roam with a SIM card from your home country. For example, if you have a SIM card from Malaysia, you can use that SIM card to roam in China while getting 2GB of data per day for only 99RM ($21 US) per month. This may be cheaper than getting a SIM card in China. However, without a local Chinese phone number, you won't be able to use some local services such as ordering takeout and buying tickets via WeChat.


## Important Notice (2025 Update)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Digital Ocean Access from China**: The DigitalOcean website and control panel are blocked in China, making it difficult to create new accounts or manage servers from within China without a VPN. However, **existing droplets set up before entering China can still be accessed and work fine**. It's strongly recommended to set up and test your servers before traveling to China.

### Recommended Server Providers (2025)
1. **Vultr** - Better connectivity to China, multiple Asian locations
2. **Linode** - Good Asian presence, reliable performance
3. **Oracle Cloud** - Offers free tier (limited resources)
4. **BandwagonHost** - Popular among Chinese users
5. **AWS Lightsail** - Works but less reliable for GFW bypass
6. **Google Cloud Platform** - Free tier available, variable success rate

**Note**: Server location matters! Choose servers in:
- Japan (lowest latency for most of China)
- Singapore 
- South Korea
- US West Coast (as backup)

## Setting up a V2ray Server

### Digital Ocean Account Setup

1. **Create a Digital Ocean Account:**
   - Sign up for a Digital Ocean account using a referral link, like this one: [Digital Ocean Referral Link](https://m.do.co/c/648197605dfe) this will give you $200 of credit to be used within 2 months.
   - Note: Students can get a $200 credit that is valid for a year via GitHub Education.

2. **Add Billing Information:**
   - Add your billing information by linking a credit card to your Digital Ocean account. While other cloud providers can be used, AWS is not recommended due to potential issues.

### Droplet Creation and Configuration

3. **Create a Droplet:**
   - In the top right-hand corner, click "Create" and then select "Droplets."

4. **Configure Server Location:**
   - Choose a server location that's closest to where you'll be in China. For example, if you're in the eastern area of China, select San Francisco. You can create multiple servers in different locations if needed.

5. **Select OS and Version:**
   - Choose "Ubuntu" as the OS image and select "Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (x64)" as the version.

6. **Choose Virtual Machine Size:**
   - Opt for "Shared CPU: Basic."

7. **CPU Options:**
   - Select "Premium AMD." If you plan to use it with just a few devices (up to 8), choose the entry-level plan starting at $4/month (512MB RAM) or $6/month (1GB RAM).

8. **Authentication Method:**
   - Select "Password" for now, or you can set up SSH authentication separately.

### Initial Server Configuration

9. **Set Hostname:**
   - Change the hostname to something of your choice, for organizational purposes.

10. **Create the Droplet:**

## Alternative Circumvention Methods (2025 Update)

As of 2025, the Great Firewall has become more sophisticated. Here are alternative and complementary methods:

### 1. **Protocol Alternatives**
- **Shadowsocks with obfuscation plugins** - Still effective with proper configuration
- **Trojan-GFW** - Mimics HTTPS traffic effectively
- **WireGuard** - Fast and lightweight, though requires careful configuration
- **Hysteria/Hysteria2** - UDP-based protocol optimized for unstable connections

### 2. **Free Tools (Use with Caution)**
- **Freegate** - Developed by Falun Gong practitioners, still actively maintained
- **Psiphon** - Open-source circumvention tool
- **Lantern** - P2P censorship circumvention tool
- **Tor with Snowflake bridges** - Requires specific configuration for China

### 3. **Commercial VPNs (Mixed Results in 2025)**
- **Surfshark** - Fast connections to nearby servers
- **Proton VPN** - Strong security features
- **Private Internet Access (PIA)**
- **Astrill** - Specifically designed for China but expensive (~$30/month)

### 4. **Non-VPN Solutions**
- **International roaming SIM cards** - Most reliable but expensive
- **Hong Kong SIM cards** - Work well if obtained before entering mainland China
- **Satellite internet** - Emerging option but heavily regulated

## Important Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning**: 
- **NEVER use plain HTTP admin panels** - They are vulnerable to interception
- Always use HTTPS with strong passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication where available
- Regularly update your server software
- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns

‚ö†Ô∏è **2025 Updates**:
- The CCP has intensified VPN crackdowns with automated detection systems
- GFW blocks outbound IPs in batches around 4 PM daily
- Server IPs may be blocked within days or weeks - have backup servers ready
